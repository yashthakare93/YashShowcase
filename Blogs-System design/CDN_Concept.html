                            <p>CDN is content delivery network has been around since 90s. It was originally developed to
                                speed up the delivery of static HTML content for users all around the world.
                                Nowadays, a CDN should be used whenever HTTP traffic is served.</p>

                            <h3 id="cdn-working">Working of a CDN</h3>
                            <p><strong>1. Content Distribution:</strong> The CDN consists of a network of servers
                                distributed across various geographic locations, known as Points of Presence (PoPs).
                                These servers store cached copies of website content, such as images, videos, scripts,
                                and other static assets.</p>
                            <p><strong>2. User Request:</strong> When a user accesses a website, their browser sends a
                                request to the website's origin server to retrieve the content. However, if the website
                                is using a CDN, the request is intercepted by the CDN's edge server located closest to
                                the user.</p>
                            <p><strong>3. Edge Server Selection:</strong> The CDN's edge server determines the user's
                                location based on factors such as IP address and network proximity. It then routes the
                                user's request to the nearest PoP in the CDN network.</p>
                            <img src="./assests/cdnworking.png" alt="CDN Working Diagram">
                            <p><strong>4.Content Delivery:</strong> The edge server at the PoP retrieves the requested
                                content from the origin server, if it's not already cached locally. It then delivers the
                                content to the user's browser.</p>
                            <p><strong>5. Caching and Optimization:</strong> The edge server caches the content locally
                                for future requests, reducing the need to fetch it from the origin server again.
                                Additionally, modern CDNs often perform optimizations such as minification, compression,
                                and format conversion to further improve performance.</p>
                            <p><strong>6. Load Balancing and Redundancy:</strong> CDNs use load balancing techniques to
                                distribute traffic evenly across their network of edge servers, preventing any single
                                server from becoming overloaded. Moreover, CDNs offer redundancy and failover mechanisms
                                to ensure high availability in case of server failures or network issues.</p>
                            <p><strong>7. Dynamic Content Delivery:</strong> While CDNs are primarily used for caching
                                static content, they also support dynamic content delivery through techniques like edge
                                computing and dynamic caching. This allows CDNs to cache and serve personalized or
                                dynamically generated content efficiently.</p>

                            <p></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Edge Servers:</strong> These are servers located at various points of
                                    presence (PoPs) around the globe. They cache content from the origin server.</li>
                                <li><strong>Origin Server:</strong> This is the main server where the original content
                                    is stored.</li>
                                <li><strong>CDN Provider:</strong> The company that provides the CDN service and
                                    infrastructure.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Two common ones are DNS-based routing and Anycast:</h3>
                            <img src="./assests/what-is-anycast-2.webp" alt="">
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>with DNS-based routing, each PoP has its own IP address. When the user Looks
                                        up the IP address for the CDN,DNS returns the IP address of the PoP closest to
                                        them.</strong>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>with Anycast, all PoPs share the same IP address. When a request comes into
                                        the Anycast network for that IP address, the network sends the request to the
                                        PoP that is closest to the requester.</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Each edge server acts as a reverse proxy with a huge content cache .Static contents are
                                cached on the edge server in this content cache. If a piece of content is in the cache,
                                it could be quickly returned to the user. Since edge server only asks for a copy of the
                                static content from the original server if it is not in its cache, this greatly reduces
                                the load and bandwidth requirements of the original server cluster.</p>

                            <h3>Content Transformation / TLS Termination</h3>
                            <img src="./assests/file-concatenation_dafc.webp" alt="">
                            <p>A modern CDN could also transform static content into more optimized formats.
                                For example, it could minify JavaScript bundles on the fly, or transform an image file
                                form an old format to modern one like WebP or AVIF.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                An edge server also serves a very important role in modern HTTP stack. All TLS
                                connections terminate at the edge server. TLS handshake are expensive .</p>
                            <h3 id="cdn-benefits">Beside performance, a modern CDN brings two other major benefits:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>

                                    Security : All modern CDNs have huge network capacity at the edge. This is the key
                                    to providing effective DDoS protection against large-scale attacks my having a
                                    network with a capacity much larger than the attackers.

                                </li>
                                <li>Availability : By having copies of content available in many PoPs, a CDN can
                                    withstand many more hardware failures than the origin servers.</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 id="cdn-providers">Popular CDN Providers</h3>
                            <p>There are several well-known CDN providers available, including:</p>
                            <ul>
